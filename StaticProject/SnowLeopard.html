            Snow Leopards can be seen in the mountains of Asia. This vulnerable species is about 4 to 5 feet in size 
            with a 36 inch tail, weighing in at 60 to 120 pounds. A Snow Leopard is considered a big cat that has insulated 
            gray or cream yellow fur and black spots. Their tail is so long because it is used to balance also covering body 
            parts that are sensitive to the elements. Snow Leopards <mark>live all throughout the mountains in the Himalayas, the 
            southern Siberian range in Russia, and the Tibetan Plateau that goes from China to Central Asia.</mark>  Even though they 
            cover a lot of ground on the steep sides of mountains and are able to jump as far as 50 feet, they tend to be shy 
            animals. These strong animals have a big appetite and can eat up to 3 times their weight. Animals such as blue sheep, 
            Argali wild sheep, ibex, marmots, pikas, and hares are part of the Snow Leopards diet.

        <h2 id="decrease">Population Decrease</h2>
        <p id="p2">
            The population of Snow Leopards in the wild is about <strong>4,080 to 6,590</strong>. Even though that sounds like a big number they are 
            on a downward slope which can be detrimental to the balance of the ecosystem. One of the biggest reasons these big cats are 
            vulnerable is due to climate change. Since they thrive in the frigid cold temperatures, climate change can have a lasting effect 
            on their habitat. If temperatures continue to rise then other animals like leopards, wild dogs, and tigers will be able to survive 
            in areas where they couldn't before. This results in the Snow Leopards competing for food. They are also in <mark>competition with hunters 
            who hunt Argali sheep for the local communities</mark>  which make it hard for them to find prey in the wild, resulting in hunting for 
            domesticated animals. For that reason there have been known killings of Snow Leopards by farmers who fear their animals such as 
            sheep, goats, horses, and yak calves will be eaten.The last threat is due to poaching, this illegal act is driven by the want for 
            their pelts as well as body parts that are used in traditional Chinese medicine.

            There have been numerous protected areas in the wild for the Snow Leopards which is good but it is still not enough room for these animals 
            to roam under protection. Males travel up to 80 square miles while females travel up to 48 square miles, so if more people understood the 
            issue the Snow Leopard would be able to roam freely and safely without a need to keep them in one area under protection. Multiple organizations 
            are working with the local communities to educate and work side by side with them to curb the amount of killings. Working with these local 
            communities also helps locals by <string>teaching</string> them how to keep Snow Leopards away from their stock without killing them. Countries have also taken 
            their own initiative by focusing more on how the law enforcement works to decrease the amount of poaching. Since one threat was climate change, 
            everyone can help the Snow Leopards as well as other animals by being more conscious of the environment when making decisions. <mark>Small steps in
