            The Antarctic Blue Whale is an endangered animal that can be found in the oceans of Antarctica. This is just one place 
            they like to roam, you can also find them in Southern Chile, Gulf of Mexico, and the Coral Triangle. This whale is 
            considered the largest animal on the planet weighing in at around <strong>200 tons</strong> and 80 to 100 feet long. Not only are they the 
            biggest but they are considered the loudest as well, their whistle can be heard hundreds of miles away which can be used to 
            attract other blue whales. Krill are small fish that the Blue Whale eats, on an average day it will eat about 4 tons of krill.

        <h2 id="decrease">Population Decrease</h2>
        <p id="p2">
            The population of Blue Whales is about 10,000 to 25,000. These whales are endangered because they are <mark>losing their habitats or have 
            toxic substances within them</mark>. Climate change is jeopardizing this animals life as well as all living things. It might not affect 
            the Blue Whales directly but it does affect the krill which then affect the whales. Like other marine animals Blue Whales are hurt 
            due to them colliding with ships or getting tangled in fishing gear. One other threat includes <strong>ocean noise</strong>. Ocean noise also known 
            as noise pollution can surprisingly have an impact on marine life animals.<img id="img2" src="Blue Whale Image/Image2.png" alt="Blue Whale Image 2"> 
            It will disrupt their normal activities such as making 
            them leave areas that are important to their survival. It will also affect their hearing, cause stress, and breeding.

        <h2 id="solution">What can be done?</h2>
        
        <p id="p3">
            There are many things that people can do for the Antarctic Blue Whale to survive. One thing people can do when observing the huge animals 
            is to look from afar, about <strong>100 yards</strong>. It is even illegal to come closer to that in some places. Keeping your distance can reduce 
            them being hit by boats or stressing them out causing a disturbance. When on a boat it is important to <mark>watch your speed and always 
            keep an eye out</mark>. Just like driving, you would normally look for people or cars which is the same idea in a boat but looking out for 
            the animals that live there. It is important to report any distress that is seen. This goes for whales and any other animal 
            wherever you may see an animal in need. For the Blue whales, reporting a sick, injured, or entangled whale could help save their 
            life. Even if the animal is dead it is important to call professionals to take the needed steps. 
            Ocean noise is being worked on by many organizations to reduce this lasting effect on the animals.
