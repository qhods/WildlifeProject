            The Galapagos Giant Tortoise lives up to its name weighing about <mark>475 pounds and around 4 feet tall.</mark> They 
            also live in the wild for 100 or more years, one of the oldest recorded tortoises age was 152.  They are considered 
            to be vulnerable which means they are at high risk of extinction. These animals live a simple lifestyle that consists 
            of eating, relaxing, and sleeping. The Giant Tortoise naps for about 16 hours a day and the other hours they lay in the 
            sun or eating grass, leaves, fruit, and cactus.<img id="img1" src="Tortoise Images/Image1.png" alt="Giant Tortoise Image 1"> 
            Eating is not on the top of their list like other animals. This is 
            because they have such a slow metabolism and can store water, it allows them to survive without consuming food or water 
            for up to a year. If it is colder out you can find them trying to warm up in the mud, water, or some type of brush. 
            Mating can happen all year but it is at its highest between January and August. After, the female tortoise will find dry 
            and sandy ground to dig a nest where the eggs will be laid. From there, 120 to 140 days after the female laid the eggs, 
            the babies leave their eggs trying to leave the nest which can take up to a month of digging up to the surface.

        <h2 id="decrease">Population Decrease</h2>
        <p id="p2">
            There are only about <strong>15,000</Strong> Giant Tortoises left which is a decrease from around 250,000 of them. Darwin, known for 
            evolution, found 15 different species of Giant Tortoises at the time. Now there are only about 10 different species left. 
            This is because tortoises were hunted by <mark>pirates, whalers, and merchantmen</mark>
            from the 17th century all the way until the 19th 
            century. This was one way these animals have become endangered. Another reason is because of animals such as:
            <ol id="p2List">
                <li>pigs</li>
                <li>dogs</li>
                <li>cats</li>
                <li>rats</li>
                <li>goats</li>
                <li>cattle</li>
            </ol> 
            <div id="p2Continuation">
                These animals are not native to the island which is causing competition for food as well as endangering the eggs of the 
                tortoise.

        <h2 id="solution">What can be done?</h2>
        <p id="p3">
            Most of the Giant Tortoise species have been <mark>declared endangered or critically endangered.</mark> The Ecuadorian government has been 
            protecting the different tortoise species since <strong>1970</strong>. The Charles Darwin Research Station has been captive breeding which has been 
            an effective measure to increase the population. The Galapagos Conservancy has been working on reducing the amount of nonnative 
            <img id="img4" src="Tortoise Images/Image4.png" alt="Giant Tortoise Image 4">
            animals that are on the islands. This allows for the eggs to not be disturbed and more grazing area for the tortoises. People can 
            look up organized trips to the galapagos where you would volunteer for a week or so and help the tortoises.
