            The European Mink is a critically endangered that used to be found all over Europe. Since there are less than <strong>30,000</strong> 
            European Minks in the area of where these animals live have recently decreased dramatically. In some areas where they used to live, 
            they have actually gone extinct.<mark>They can be found in banks by fresh water rivers, creeks and lakes.</mark> They tend to wander on 
            their own hoping from den to den. <img id="img1" src="Mink Images/Image1.png" alt="Mink Image 1">
            Except for females who usually stay close to their den except for when food is scarce then 
            they will also move dens. European Minks prey on rabbits, birds, fish, crayfish, and frogs. These animals have multiple mating 
            partners that take place from February to March with a litter between 2 to 7.

            European Minks are critically endangered because of one of the main things they rely on, <strong>water</strong>. The water they rely on and live 
            near have been <mark>polluted by people as well as the natural systems</mark> such as dams have been modified. Water is not the only thing 
            that is being tampered with by humans that are hurting this species. These animals tend to be trapped and killed for their fur. 
            There have also been deaths due to human activity such as vehicle collisions and pest control trapping where the Minks would 
            accidentally be trapped therefore being poisoned. The last well known threat is because European MInks as well as all minks are 
            prone to Aleutian disease that is contagious and deadly to the species.

        <h2 id="solution">What can be done?</h2>
        <p id="p3">
            These issues have been addressed using many different methods. There are multiple conservation sites as well as a protected 
            area. Protection for these animals is happening all over Europe. Countries are participating in conservation breeding programs 
            where they have seen an <mark>increase in population in captivity</mark>. Some programs in countries are <strong>reintroducing</strong> them to the wild and 
            after monitoring found a small population. All countries are also taking action to improve the quality of their habitat.
