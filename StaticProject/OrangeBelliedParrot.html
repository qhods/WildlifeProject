            Orange-bellied Parrots can be found in Australia more specifically the <mark>southwest area of Tasmania.</mark>  These birds 
            are only about 46 grams or 1.6 ounces. Their size is 20 centimeters long, in conclusion these birds are very small 
            animals. That does not stop them from being seen. The males are very bright birds consisting of a bright green body 
            with accents of yellow green mix on their chest, blue stripe on its head as well as blue wings, and an orange patch at 
            the bottom of their belly. <img id="img1" src="Parrot Images/Image1.png" alt="Orange-Bellied Parrot Image 1">
            Female birds have the same look but slightly darker colors. Orange Bellied Parrots will have 
            one breeding partner for life, the only time they will find another is if one of the partners dies. Breeding happens from 
            November to February, this is when the females create nests in hollowed out Smithton peppermint trees to incubate the eggs. 
            Like most birds they will eat berries, seeds, and beaded or shrubby glasswort.

        <h2 id="decrease">Population Decrease</h2>
        <p id="p2">
            The population of these critically endangered birds are <strong>14</strong> known birds left in the wild. Fortunately, there are about 200 
            of these birds in captivity which is good so that the species will still be on the earth but unfortunate that they <mark>canâ€™t be 
            out in the wild themselves.</mark> Other factors that contribute to their decline in population is due to:
            <ol id="p2List">
                <li>habitat loss</li>
                <li>being preyed on by cats and foxes</li>
                <li>spread of harmful weeds</li>
                <li>flying into structures</li>
                <li>inbreeding since there is such a small population</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2 id="solution">What can be done?</h2>
        <p id="p3">
            The Australian Government has been working tirelessly along with other organizations to protect the Orange-Bellied Parrots. 
            There has been a promised <strong>$3.2 million</strong> in efforts to bring back this species. Captive breeding has been a big success in 
            bringing these birds back to a decent population size. The hope is that there will be enough captive breeding so that eventually 
            more can be released back into the wild. The Orange-Bellied Parrots breed in the summer in Tasmania which is off the coast of 
            Australia and breed in the winter on the coast of South Australia. Since they breed in two different places there has been an 
           <mark>effort to conserve their habitat in both areas as well as improving it.</mark> There has been an attempt to control the animals that 
            prey on these birds to give them a chance to increase their population.
