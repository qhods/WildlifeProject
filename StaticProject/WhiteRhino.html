            The White Rhino is a near threatened species found in Africa. They spend most of their time in the grasslands across 4 
            countries which are South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. White Rhinos are gray in color and a lip shape that is square. 
            <img id="img1" src="White Rhino Images/Image1.png" alt="White Rhino Image 1">
            The lip shape is how you can determine whether it is a White Rhino or not. Their lips are square because they mostly eat grass. 
            The weight of a white rhino has a range from <strong>3,080 pounds to 7,920 pounds</strong>. White Rhinos are another animal that tend to stay in 
            groups of about 14 rhinos, mostly made of females and their calves. Their calves will stay with the group for about 3 years then 
            they will go out on their own. These animals have a population of about 18,000 but the population could continue to decrease.

            White Rhinos have two horns that can grow up to 3 inches a year and 5 feet long total. Their horns are used to protect young and 
            for battle. Their horns make them vulnerable to humans because <mark>rhinos are most likely killed for the want of their horns</mark>. The 
            horns  have been used in medicine in places like:
            <ol id="p2List">
                <li class="listDecrease">China</li>
                <li class="listDecrease">Taiwan</li>
                <li class="listDecrease">Hong Kong</li>
                <li class="listDecrease">Singapore</li>
            </ol> <div id="p2Continuation">
                Their horns are also used as an 
            ornamental dagger handle in North Africa and the Middle East.
            <strong>Poaching</strong> is also a major reason for the decrease in the population 
            of White Rhinos. This type of rhino is most hunted as well due to their calm nature, they are known to be not very aggressive. 
            Habitat loss like other animals, is a factor that has to be taken into consideration when determining why this species is on the 
            downfall. White Rhinos are losing their habitat to agriculture and settlements.

            There are now new technologies that have been able to help the protection of the animals. There are <mark>thermal imaging systems</mark>
             that monitor the rhinos and all wildlife from poachers. Along with the technology, there has been an increase in anti poaching 
            patrols as well as better equipped conservation law enforcement to enforce the rules. The countries in Africa have been working 
            hard to bring justice to the innocent animals.
