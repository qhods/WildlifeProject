            Red wolves are among the most endangered wolves in North America. Red wolves get 
                the name from the red color that is seen on their ears, head, and legs. They are mostly a 
                brown color and some even have black fur going down their back.
            These beautiful animals used to roam free from Pennsylvania, down to Florida, and the southern states all the way 
            over to about the middle of Texas. <img id="img1" src="Red Wolf Images/Image1.png" alt="Red Wolf Image 1">Red wolves have been found living in many different types of 
            habitats but unfortunately they are <mark>currently found in North Carolina.</mark> Red wolves tend to prey on 
            smaller mammals such as racoons, white-tailed deer, rabbits, and rodents. Red wolves mate for life 
            and value their pack that consists of 5 to 8 wolves that are their offspring. These social animals 
            will breed every February, which is why the pack will have all different aged offspring. These animals 
            have a family-like dynamic where the older ones will help the parents by taking care of the younger pups 
            as well as protecting the den where the younger ones are left to mature. Due to them living in different 
            habitats, their dens can be found anywhere from holes in the ground to stream banks, and even hollowed out 
            trees. After about 1 to 3 years the older wolves will leave finding their own mate and territory. Unfortunately, 
            for these young wolves it will be hard for them to find mates and live to their expectancy due to the rapid 
            decline in population.

        <h2 id="decrease">Population Decrease</h2>
        <p id="p2">
            The population in the wild decreased to <strong>14</strong> animals at one point. The red wolf population decrease can be linked 
            to human activity such as: 
            <ol>
                <li class="listDecrease">hunting the wolves</li>
                <li class="listDecrease">car accidents</li>
                <li class="listDecrease">building new developments</li>
            </ol> 
            <div id="p2Continuation">
                Since there are so many 
            houses and people the wolves don’t have as much land to roam around as well as other animals of similar species like coyotes. 
            Due to coyotes and red wolves crossing paths they have to fight for food and land. Coyotes can also be a threat to the red wolf 
            by transmitting diseases and hybridization. Hybridization is when a species like a red wolf breeds with other species like a coyote. 
            This is not good for red wolves because there are not many left so the red wolf genes should be conserved so hopefully in the future 
            there will be true red wolves in the wild. Since they now live on the coast of North Carolina the new threat includes rising sea levels 
            due to climate change. This could also have a long term effect on the red wolves by making them move inland, being confronted with humans 
            that can hurt these animals on accident or some people do it on purpose.

        <h2 id="solution">What can be done?</h2>
        <p id="p3">
            As mentioned before, hybridization is an issue especially when it is mating season and an adult of the pack is gone due to the threats stated 
            above. To conserve the red wolf genes wildlife managers have been capturing coyotes that are particularly territorial and sterilizing them which 
            allows the red wolves to increase in numbers with preserved red wolf genes, not a mix of coyotes. <mark>Climate change</mark> is affecting red wolves negatively 
            as well as other animals, if people contribute to reversing climate change animals will be able to thrive. Since the capture and release of wolves back 
            in the 1900’s there were 130 red wolves by the late 2000’s but unfortunately they have decreased recently to 20 known wolves in the wild due to human 
            interaction. To help people distinguish wolves and coyotes, bright orange radio collars have been placed and still continue to be placed on red wolves 
            in hopes that people will respect the decreasing population and allow the red wolves to be left alone.
            <img id="img4" src="Red Wolf Images/Image4.png" alt="Red Wolf Image 4"> Even though the captive population is flourishing 
            with <strong>245</strong> red wolves it is still unfortunate that they have to be in protection due to humans being the number one cause in the decline of wild red wolves. 
            All the things wildlife conservations are doing like safe facilities for the animals and radio tracking collars for ones in the wild, people still need to 
            be more alert and compassionate for the critically endangered species.
